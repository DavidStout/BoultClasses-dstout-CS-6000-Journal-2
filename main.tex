\section{Process and Learning}
\subsection{The Browse}
For The Browse, I found that it was a little difficult to not read too much. I began my first few papers and found myself trying to read parts of the intro and conclusion to learn more about the paper to determine if I would want to scan it later, but after a few papers I realized that this is not the method that we are going for. So I tried to just do as the class slides suggested and read the abstract and scan the figures, then to mainly go with my gut if I was interested in the paper. I found this method to be much faster and really helped to weed out the papers that I just didn't really care about currently. It also brought to light papers that I may not care about now, but might want to read later for future research, which was nice to put in my notes in Zotero so that I can quickly reference them again at a later date.
